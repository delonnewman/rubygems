== Creating the Gem Specification ==

The GemSpecification is a Ruby script that, when run, creates a 
Gem::Specification object.  In a normal Ruby library development 
you would have your Ruby files laid out something like this:

  <project dir>/
    <i>install.rb or setup.rb</i>
    lib/
      mylib.rb
      mylib/
        file1.rb
        file2.rb ...etc
    test/
      test_mylib.rb ...etc
    
Although not a requirement, it is recommended to place your Gem 
Specification object definition in a .gemspec file at the root 
of your project directory:

  <project dir>/
    mylib.gemspec

To create a GemSpecification file, it easiest to start with the 
example here and then modify it for you own needs (per the 
GemSpecification format detail).  

The following .gemspec file is from the jabber4r project

  require 'rubygems'

Currently it is necessary to require the 'rubygems' file.  
It may be under a new version of Ruby that the rubygems file 
will be required by default, thus obviating the need for this require.

  spec = Gem::Specification.new do |s|
    s.add_dependency('rubyjdwp', '= 0.0.4')
    s.name = 'jabber4r'
    s.version = "0.5.0"
    s.platform = Gem::Platform::RUBY
    s.summary = "Jabber4r is a pure-Ruby Jabber client library"
    s.requirements << 'Jabber server'
    s.files = Dir.glob("lib/**/*").delete_if {|item| item.include?("CVS")}
    s.require_path = 'lib'
    s.autorequire = 'jabber4r/jabber4r'
    s.author = "Richard Kilmer"
    s.email = "rich@infoether.com"
    s.rubyforge_project = "jabber4r"
    s.homepage = "http://jabber4r.rubyforge.org"
  end

The next bit of code allows the .gemspec file to be executed 
as Ruby code, and load the previously defined spec.  This code 
is not strictly needed, but is a simple thing to include to 
enable the .gemspec to generate the .gem file directly.  The 
alternative is to use the <b>gem -b <foo.gemspec></b> command 
to build the gem.

  if $0==__FILE__
    Gem::Builder.new(spec).build
  end
