== Creating the Gem Specification ==

The GemSpecification is a Ruby script that, when run, creates a 
Gem::Specification object.  In a normal Ruby library development 
you would have your Ruby files laid out something like this:

  <project dir>/
    <i>install.rb or setup.rb</i>
    lib/
      mylib.rb
      mylib/
        file1.rb
        file2.rb ...etc
    test/
      test_mylib.rb ...etc
    
Although not a requirement, it is recommended to place your Gem 
Specification object definition in a .gemspec file at the root 
of your project directory:

  <project dir>/
    mylib.gemspec

To create a GemSpecification file, it easiest to start with the 
example here and then modify it for you own needs (per the 
GemSpecification format detail).  

The following .gemspec file is from the jabber4r project

  require 'rubygems'

Currently it is necessary to require the 'rubygems' file.  
It may be under a new version of Ruby that the rubygems file 
will be required by default, thus obviating the need for this require.

  spec = Gem::Specification.new do |s|
    s.add_dependency('rubyjdwp', '= 0.0.4')
    s.name = 'jabber4r'
    s.version = "0.5.0"
    s.platform = Gem::Platform::RUBY
    s.summary = "Jabber4r is a pure-Ruby Jabber client library"
    s.requirements << 'Jabber server'
    s.files = Dir.glob("lib/**/*").delete_if {|item| item.include?("CVS")}
    s.require_path = 'lib'
    s.autorequire = 'jabber4r/jabber4r'
    s.author = "Richard Kilmer"
    s.email = "rich@infoether.com"
    s.rubyforge_project = "jabber4r"
    s.homepage = "http://jabber4r.rubyforge.org"
  end

The next bit of code allows the .gemspec file to be executed 
as Ruby code, and load the previously defined spec.  This code 
is not strictly needed, but is a simple thing to include to 
enable the .gemspec to generate the .gem file directly.  The 
alternative is to use the <b>gem -b <foo.gemspec></b> command 
to build the gem.

  if $0==__FILE__
    Gem::Builder.new(spec).build
  end


== Creating the Gem ==

Now that you've got a Gem specification built, you're almost done.  Gem::Builder.new(spec).build actually creates the gem file for you.  So, al lyou have to do is:

  $ ruby jabber4r.gemspec
     Successfully built RubyGem
     Name: jabber4r
     Version: 0.0.4
     File: jabber4r-0.0.4.gem

  $ ls *gem
  jabber4r-0.0.4.gem 

You'll notice if you open this gem file in an editor, that it too is a ruby source file.   It contains all of the files listed in the gem specification, compressed and encoded as a YAML document.  This means gem files are only slightly larger than equivalent tar/gzipped files.

You can now install the gem on a system with either of the following two commands:

  $ ruby jabber4r-0.0.4.gem
Successfully installed jabber4r version 0.0.4

...or...
  
  $ gem -i jabber4-0.0.4.gem
Successfully installed RedCloth version 0.0.4


== Distributing the Gem ==

Gems can be distributed like any file.  However, there is a mechanism builtin into the Gem command that enables automatic download and installation of gems and their dependencies.  To take advantage of this distribution mechanism, you have to upload your gem files to a host that is listed in the Gem sources package.  

By default, the primary source is http://gems.rubyforge.org.  For now (the Alpha release), if you would like to include a gem in the primary distribution site, please email Rich Kilmer (rich<at>infoether.com) or Chad Fowler (chad<at>chadfowler.com).  

We plan shortly after the first alpha release to integrate the primary gem source with RubyForge's file release tool, so for RubyForge users, gem distribution will be as simple as releasing your file on RubyForge.
