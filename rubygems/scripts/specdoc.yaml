ATTRIBUTES:

  - name: files
    description:
      This is the list of files (to be) contained in the gem.  It is an array.
    usage:
        require 'rake'
        spec.files = FileList['lib/**/*.rb', 'bin/*', '[A-Z]*', 'test/**/*'].to_a
        # or without Rake...
        spec.files = Dir['lib/**/*.rb'] + Dir['bin/*']
        spec.files << Dir['[A-Z]*'] + Dir['test/**/*']
        spec.files.reject! { |fn| fn.include? "CVS" }
    notes:
      You don't need to use Rake, obviously, but specifying the files is much
      easier with it than without it.
