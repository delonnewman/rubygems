ATTRIBUTES:

  - name: author
    mandatory: 
    default: 
    description:
      The author of the package contained in the gem.
    usage:
        spec.author = "John Jones"
    notes:

  - name: autorequire
    mandatory: 
    default: nil
    description:
      The file that will be loaded when <tt>require_gem<tt> is called.  It is
      a shortcut so the user doesn't have to do what seems to be a redundant
      <tt>require</tt>.
    usage:
        spec.name = 'rake'
        spec.files = ['lib/rake.rb", "lib/rake/**/*.rb", ...]
        spec.autorequire = 'rake'
    notes:
      In the above example, when the user's code calls <tt>require_gem
      'rake'</tt>, an implicit <tt>require 'rake'</tt> is called afterwards.

      Specifying <tt>autorequire</tt> is optional.  If there is no single
      default file that should be loaded, then it doesn't make sense to
      specify it.

  - name: bindir
    mandatory: 
    default: bin
    description:
      The directory containing the executable files, if any.
    usage:
        spec.bindir = 'bin'
    notes:
      An "executable file" is a file that is intended to be run from the
      command line.  It is an application, rather than a library file.  If
      your package contains such files, they will typically be placed in a
      <tt>bin</tt> directory, hence the name ''bindir''.

  - name: default_executable
    mandatory: 
    default: ...
    description:
      Of all the application files in the package, the ''default executable''
      is the one that can be run directly through the gem.
    usage:
        spec.executables = ['bin/foo', 'bin/bar']
        spec.default_executable = 'bin/bar'
    notes:
      If you only specify one application file in ''executables'', that file
      becomes the default executable.  Therefore, you only need to specify
      this value if you have more than one application file.

      The notion of running applications directly through a gem is not well
      supported at the moment.  The idea is that you can download a gem, say
      <tt>monopoly.gem</tt> (the board game), and run <tt>gem
      monopoly.gem</tt>, which would run the <tt>monopoly</tt> application.
      This is not an in-demand feature.

  - name: description
    mandatory: '?'
    default: 
    description:
      This describes the gem in detail.  See also ''summary''.
    usage:
        spec.description = <<-EOF
          Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and
          dependencies are specified in standard Ruby syntax.
        EOF
    notes:
      When the gem is built, the description is re-formatted into a single
      line with sensible whitespace.  This means you can use here-docs with
      formatting, as demonstrated above, without worrying about the
      formatting.

      ''Something about description vs summary...''

  - name: docs
    mandatory: 
    default: 
    description:
      ???
    usage:
        ...
    notes:
      ...

  - name: email
    mandatory: 
    default: 
    description:
      The author's email address.
    usage:
        spec.email = 'john.jones@somewhere.com'
    notes:

  - name: executables
    mandatory: 
    default: 
    description:
      "''executables'' is a list of files in the package that are
      applications."
    usage:
        spec.executables << 'rake'
    notes:
      For example, the <tt>rake</tt> gem has <tt>rake</tt> as an executable.
      You don't specify the full path (as in <tt>bin/rake</tt>); all
      application-style files are expected to be found in L(bindir).

  - name: extensions
    mandatory: 
    default: 
    description:
      The paths to <tt>extconf.rb</tt>-style files used to compile
      extensions.
    usage:
        spec.extensions << 'ext/rmagic/extconf.rb'
    notes:
      These files will be run when the gem is installed, causing the C (or
      whatever) code to be compiled on the user's machine.

      ''Any other comments?''

  - name: extra_rdoc_files
    mandatory: 
    default: 
    description:
      A list of non-code files that will be used by RDoc to generate the
      documentation.
    usage:
        spec.extra_rdoc_files = ['README', 'doc/user-guide.txt']
    notes:
      When the user elects to generate the RDoc documentation for a gem
      (typically at install time), all the library files are sent to RDoc for
      processing.  This option allows you to have some non-code files included
      for a more complete set of documentation.

  - name: files
    mandatory: 
    default: 
    description:
      This is the list of files (to be) contained in the gem.  It is an array.
    usage:
        require 'rake'
        spec.files = FileList['lib/**/*.rb', 'bin/*', '[A-Z]*', 'test/**/*'].to_a
        # or without Rake...
        spec.files = Dir['lib/**/*.rb'] + Dir['bin/*']
        spec.files << Dir['[A-Z]*'] + Dir['test/**/*']
        spec.files.reject! { |fn| fn.include? "CVS" }
    notes:
      You don't need to use Rake, obviously, but specifying the files is much
      easier with it than without it.
