= Gemspecs in Detail =

In order to create a gem, you need to define a specification, commonly called
a "gemspec".  This document details these gemspecs.  For an overview of the
process of creating a gem, see CreateAGemInTenMinutes.

A gemspec consists of several ''attributes''.  Some of these are required;
most of them are optional.

== Contents ==

This document contains an overview of each attribute, containing a usage example
and some notes.  They are listed in alphabetical order.  The tables of contents
below provide themed and alphabetical indices to the attribute list.
