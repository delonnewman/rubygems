* Better error handling (what if a dependency fails to install?  or the target gem fails....remove the dependencies which were just installed?)
* Binary package support 
* RPM, Mac OS dmg/pkg, Debian pkg, MSI, etc. conversion (at least one or two)
* require_gem 'ruby', '= 1.8.1'
* ri data generation
