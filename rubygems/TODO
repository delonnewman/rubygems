Alpha release 1:
---------------
* Bring gem_server.cgi back in sync with gem_server.  
* Abstract the logic from gem_server*, so we don't have to worry about keeping them in sync
* raa-install conversion (or some other way to get a decent amount of gems up)

Straddling the line
-------------------
* Binary package support 

After alpha:
------------
* RPM, Mac OS dmg/pkg, Debian pkg conversion
* HTTP Proxy connections #can borrow from raa-install
